    <h1>Demonstrating <code>line-height</code> with a Short Story</h1>

    <p class="normal">
      <strong>normal</strong>: As the sun rose over the sleepy village, Emma
      packed her bag and set off down the winding path. Birds sang overhead, and
      the morning air smelled of dew and wildflowers. She wondered what
      adventures the day would bring.
    </p>

    <p class="unitless">
      <strong>1.5 (unitless)</strong>: Marcus stepped onto the old wooden
      bridge, the river roaring beneath his feet. He paused to admire the
      dancing reflections of light on water, then continued his journey toward
      the distant mountains.
    </p>

    <p class="double-line-height">
      <strong>2x (double)</strong>: Marcus stepped onto the old wooden bridge,
      the river roaring beneath his feet. He paused to admire the dancing
      reflections of light on water, then continued his journey toward the
      distant mountains.
    </p>

    <p class="px-based">
      <strong>24px</strong>: A gentle breeze rustled through the wheat fields as
      Clara strolled at dusk. She collected a handful of golden stalks, feeling
      the soft grain slip through her fingers, and smiled at the horizon painted
      in shades of amber.
    </p>

    <p class="em-based">
      <strong>1.5em</strong>: Under the ancient oak, Samuel spread out his map
      and compass, tracing hidden trails to forgotten ruins. The canopy above
      filtered the sunlight, creating patterns that danced across the parchment.
    </p>

    <p class="percent">
      <strong>150%</strong>: The lighthouse keeper lit the beacon just as storm
      clouds gathered on the horizon. Waves pounded against the cliffside, and
      the beam of light cut through the mist, guiding sailors safely home.
