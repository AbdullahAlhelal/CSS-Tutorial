    <!-- This paragraph has n element selector, an ID, a class, and an inline style -->
    <p id="special" class="important" style="color: red;">
        This text will be red because inline styles win the contest!
    </p>

    <!-- This paragraph has an element selector, an ID, a class -->
    <p id="special" class="important">
        This text will be orange because ID slector win the contest!
    </p>

    <!-- This paragraph has element selector and  a class selector -->
    <p class="important">
        This text will be green because class slector win the contest!
    </p>

    <!-- This paragraph has only element selectore -->
    <p>
        This text will be blue because element slector has lowest specificity and no other specificity compete with it.

<!-- What is Specificity?
- Definition: Specificity is a system used by browsers to decide which CSS rule should be applied if multiple rules target the same element.

-How It Works: CSS rules are ranked by specificity in the following order (from highest to lowest):

1- Inline styles (e.g., <p style="color: red;">)
2- IDs (e.g., #header)
3- Classes, attributes, and pseudo-classes (e.g., .highlight, [type="text"], :hover)
4- Elements and pseudo-elements (e.g., p, h1, ::first-line)

- Imagine specificity as a contest 🏆 where the rule with the highest specificity takes home the styling prize! -->
