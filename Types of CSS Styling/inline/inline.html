<!-- 
Pros:
  - Immediate and high specificity (takes higher priority).
  - Great for debugging or temporary styling.
Cons:
  -Can clutter HTML code if overused:
    - While inline styling is useful for quick fixes or when you need to style a single element uniquely, overusing it can clutter your HTML code.
    -This happens because your style information becomes mixed in with your HTML content, making the code harder to read, debug, and maintain.
    -Instead, using internal or external CSS keeps your code cleaner by separating style from content.
  - Not reusable: styles are limited to the element they are applied to.
  - Increase the html size.
